This article is a buit more recent than the code, but this visualization is a kind of open-mindedness demonstration of your brain correcting what you perceive.  you will experience your eyes involuntarily fighting the picture.

excerpt: https://nomadrs.com/open-minded-people-different-visual-perception-reality/


>What is it about a creative piece of work such as a painting or music that brings us feelings of awe and wonder?

>Is it the thrill of being shown something new and different? Something the artist saw that we could not?

>As Pablo Picasso put it:

>“Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.”

[ ... ]

>They then tested who experienced a visual perceptual phenomenon called “binocular rivalry”. This happens when each eye is shown a different image from having red and green patches over each eye. The result is having different images being displayed to each eye.
 
>Most people will switch back and forth between the two incompatible images, as the brain struggles to perceive the two images at the same time.
