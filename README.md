This article is a buit more recent than the code, but this visualization is a kind of open-mindedness demonstration of your brain correcting what you perceive.  you will experience your eyes involuntarily fighting the picture.

>What is it about a creative piece of work such as a painting or music that brings us feelings of awe and wonder?

>Is it the thrill of being shown something new and different? Something the artist saw that we could not?

>As Pablo Picasso put it:

>“Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.”

>Recent research has suggested that open-minded people — those who regularly experience wonder and awe — actually see the world differently. Open-mindedness makes them more likely to experience certain visual perceptions.

>Check out the video below where we explain this phenomenon. Or keep on reading if you prefer not to watch the video.
 
>The research was published in the Journal of Research in Personality. The researchers from the University of Melbourne in Australia recruited 123 volunteers and gave them the big five personality test, which measures extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience.

>This last personality trait involves being creative, imaginative and possessing a willingness to try new things.
 
>They then tested who experienced a visual perceptual phenomenon called “binocular rivalry”. This happens when each eye is shown a different image from having red and green patches over each eye. The result is having different images being displayed to each eye.
 
>Most people will switch back and forth between the two incompatible images, as the brain struggles to perceive the two images at the same time.
